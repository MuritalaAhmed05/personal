      <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Master React and modern JavaScript frameworks:</b>
          Over the next two years, I plan to master React by creating
          increasingly complex applications. This will involve deep diving into
          advanced concepts such as hooks, the context API, and performance
          optimization techniques. I also intend to explore other modern
          JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js and Angular. By understanding their
          unique features and use cases, I will become more versatile and better
          prepared to select the right tool for any project.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Contribute to open-source projects:</b>
          I believe in the power of community and collaboration. By contributing
          to open-source projects, I aim to not only give back but also learn
          from seasoned developers. My contributions will start with small bug
          fixes and documentation improvements and gradually move towards
          implementing new features. This journey will enhance my coding skills,
          introduce me to best practices, and provide a platform to interact
          with a global community of developers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Build a strong portfolio with real-world projects:</b>
          A strong portfolio is crucial for demonstrating my skills and
          capabilities. Over the next two years, I will focus on creating a
          diverse range of projects that showcase my expertise in various
          aspects of frontend development. These projects will include
          responsive web applications, single-page applications (SPAs), and
          progressive web apps (PWAs). I will also incorporate third-party APIs,
          ensuring each project solves a real-world problem or fulfills a
          genuine need.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Learn backend development (Node.js, Express):</b>
          To become a well-rounded developer, I will expand my skill set to
          include backend development. My goal is to become proficient with
          Node.js and Express, enabling me to build and maintain robust
          server-side applications. I will learn about RESTful API design,
          authentication, middleware, and database management with MongoDB and
          SQL. This knowledge will allow me to develop full-stack applications
          and understand the complete lifecycle of web applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            >Improve problem-solving skills through regular coding
            practice:</b
          >
          Problem-solving is a critical skill for any developer. To enhance this
          skill, I will dedicate time to regular coding practice on platforms
          like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codewars. By solving a variety of
          coding challenges, I will improve my algorithmic thinking and ability
          to write efficient, optimized code. This practice will not only
          prepare me for technical interviews but also sharpen my skills for
          real-world problem-solving scenarios.
